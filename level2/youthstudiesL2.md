## Confirmation

Between September and June, Confirmands (students in Confirmation class) meet once a week for two years to study the Scriptures and Martin Luther’s Small Catechism.  Confirmands meet on Sundays from 9:30 to 10:30 AM.

## Youth Group – Jr. and Sr. High

Redeemer Lutheran offers a Youth Group for children from the 6th grade up through Senior year of High School. The Youth Group’s goal is to promote worship among young people and encourage Christian fellowship. In a world that is not so accepting, the Youth Group is a place for young Christians to have fun while being a part of a group that shares their same beliefs.

The High School meets every Sunday morning for Bible Study at 9:30 a.m. in the Youth Room, while the Jr. High (Middle School) meet for confirmation in the Music Room and Pastor’s office during the same time. On the first Sunday of the month we have a Breakfast Club and Youth Meeting. Once a month we have a Youth activity such as a game night, art activity, off campus outing, or servant event and dinner is usually included. Our Youth are encouraged to take part in our church by acolyting, ushering, or helping with different needs around our church.

We value our Youth and know that Jesus has saved them through Word and Sacrament, just as He has us all. Thanks be to God for our Youth!

*We always thank God for all of you and continually mention you in our prayers. We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we know, brothers and sisters loved by God, that he has chosen you, because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction.*

**1 Thessalonians 1:2-5**
