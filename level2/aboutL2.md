The old adage “if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything” couldn’t be more true when it comes to the beliefs, values and strengths of a Christian congregation.  The four “solas” engraved on the front sign are much more than a cute slogan — it is our guideline when it comes to our faith and life, pointing to the good gifts given and our commitment to, by God’s grace in Christ, be faithful to them.


## SCRIPTURE ALONE

The belief that the Word of God (Holy Scripture) is the sole authority and measuring stick when it comes to the faith and life of the Christian Church.  (See Matthew 22:29; John 17:17; Acts 17:11.)


## GRACE ALONE

The teaching of Scripture that salvation is — from beginning to end — completely by God’s grace apart from doing good works.  (See Ephesians 2:8-9.)


## FAITH ALONE

The teaching of Scripture that only faith can receive the freely-given gifts of God’s grace.  (See Romans 3:28.)
## CHRIST ALONE

The teaching of the Bible that salvation is to be found in Christ Jesus and no other.  (See John 14:6.)


## VISION STATEMENT

These truths are reflected in the congregation’s vision statement:
Redeemer Lutheran is enabled by God’s grace to witness clearly to Christ and his Word through caring service.
This understanding of what God in Christ has called us to be and to do can be boiled down to the phrase “clear witness + caring service,” a phrase that gives balance to faith and life, to belief and the ways in which our beliefs spill over into the lives of those around us.


## MISSION STATEMENT

To receive God’s gifts of Word and Sacrament, worship Him and grow in His grace and share those Holy gifts, by making disciples of Christ, who reach out joyfully to the world around them.


## SEVEN MARKS OF A FAITHFUL CHURCH

Below are important things that characterize Redeemer Lutheran.  They describe who we are and what we’re all about.

1 Worship services that reflect reverence and good order and a place for all believers, regardless of age.  (We are a community-friendly and family-friendly congregation.)  
2 An ever-deepening appreciation for the rich history of Christianity as reflected in the prayers, creeds, hymns and liturgy of the church.  
3 The constant proclamation of Jesus Christ as the one substitutionary sacrifice graciously offered upon the Cross for the redemption of the world.  
4 Belief in the real and saving presence of Christ through the Word of God “in, with, and under” the prophets and apostles (the Holy Bible); water (Holy Baptism); and bread and wine (Holy Communion).  
5 Faithfulness to the Word of God along with the proper distinction between Law and Gospel, Moses and Christ, commandment and promise, repentance and joy.  
6 Belief that the order of salvation is first Christ’s all-sufficient sacrifice (from heaven to earth) followed by the congregation’s free sacrifice of thanksgiving (from earth to heaven).  
7 The belief that the Word of God in Christ through the Holy Spirit is the only source for a truly God-pleasing life of faith and service to God and our neighbor.  


## A HIGH PRIORITY ON THE GIFTS OF MUSIC

Wherever God establishes the Christian Church, the gifts of music are given to God’s people.  Redeemer Lutheran affirms these gifts and believes they should be used in service to God and to the Christian community.  Music will have a central place in heaven, and that importance should be reflected in our church family.  At Redeemer Lutheran, music is not the property of the pastor or choir of “professional musician.”  Everyone is encouraged to sing back to God the blessings He has freely given us through His Son.


## WE BELIEVE IN A LIFE THAT HEARS, STUDIES AND TAKES TO HEART THE WORD OF GOD

Christian education is also a great priority at Redeemer Lutheran.  Schools are a great strength of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod — from local preschools to a national university system (that includes Concordia University Irvine).


## FURTHERING MINISTRY AT REDEEMER LUTHERAN — TOGETHER

Plans are now underway to enhance ministry at Redeemer Lutheran through a master plan that furthers the congregation’s God-given strengths for not only the church and school but also the community in which we live.


## THE GREAT HERITAGE OF THE REFORMATION

Redeemer Lutheran acknowledges the work of God through Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation.  We believe that through the Reformers, Christ called the Christian Church back to the clear foundations of the Christian faith.  (See the Small Catechism of Martin Luther and the four “solas” above.)
