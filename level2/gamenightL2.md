Come join us in faith, friendship and Tabletop Board gaming. We meet once a month on the 3rd Saturday of the month from 5:30 to 10 PM in the Fellowship Hall at Redeemer Lutheran Church in Huntington Beach, 16351 Springdale St between Edinger and Heil. There is plenty of parking at the side of the building.
